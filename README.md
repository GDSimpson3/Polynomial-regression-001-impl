## Polynomial_regression_impl_001_Dynamic_Exponents_3SLOTS_6PARAM-DSQuadratic

Works on a simple Quadratic Dataset

Uses 6 Parameters: 

`Ca,Ea,Cb,Eb,Cc,Ec`

Coefficient A, Exponent A, Coefficient B, Exponent B, Coefficient C, Exponent C

Uses the Gradient Descent to find the best exponents and Coefficients

Currently was able to bring MSE down to 3 with 20,000 iterations

# Info

Regression lines to map non-linear functions.

This includes multi-degree predicted values for the loss functions & hence tailored partial derivatives.

Additionally looking to make it Dynamic (up to any degree)
